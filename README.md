## Install

On a clean Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ server, as root:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alfred-1313/Ciro/master/install.sh)
```

Have ready: a domain already pointed at the server, a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and your numeric id from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

After installing, manage it with the `ciro` command:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ciro` | Open the menu |
| `ciro update` | Get the newest version; your data and `config.php` are kept |
| `ciro backup` | Send a database backup to Telegram |
| `ciro renew` | Reissue the SSL certificate |
| `ciro --help` | Every command and option |

Already running a bot of the original project, or an older version of this one? Run the same install command and choose **Update** or **Migrate** — nothing is reinstalled and no data is lost.
